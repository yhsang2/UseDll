# UseDll 🔧

A simple C# example project that demonstrates how to **create a DLL** and **use it in another project**.

---

## 📘 What Is This

- The `Test_CreateDLL` project builds a DLL (Dynamic Link Library).  
- The `Test_UseDLL` project references and uses that DLL, showcasing how to call functions from an external library.  
- This repo serves as a minimal example for using DLLs in a C#/.NET environment.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open **`Test_UseDLL.sln`** in your IDE (e.g. Visual Studio).  
2. Build and run the solution — nothing else is needed.  
3. The referenced DLL from `Test_CreateDLL` will be automatically used.
